- 👋 Hi, I’m @sensewords. I design puzzles.  
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning and studying. Trying to find some new applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...how not to be an old man. That's harder than one might think.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... stuff? My stuff doesn't really have much utility outside of making pretty pictures.
- 📫 How to reach me ... If you know you know. if you don't I'll be posting a message box address soon. Puzzle prototypes are still in the works.

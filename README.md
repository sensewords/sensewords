PLease be respectful. Take what you need and leave the rest. 

If you would like to try and solve one of my custom puzzles let me know and I would be overjoyed to build one for you. I respecfully ask you not violate any local laws, international laws, conventions, or commit a war crime in the process.
And don't be sad if you cant solve one while your "dumb" friend can figure it out in a few minutes.

Here be functions that served a practical purpose../../

Yours Truly,
